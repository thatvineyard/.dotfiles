DEPRECATED: replaced by http://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit

This repository is now deprecated in favor of
https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit.

While bug fixes will still be applied, no new development will take
place on this version of the starter kit.

The new starter kit has a number of benefits, including...
- lighter weight, simpler and with less default settings
- no usage of git submodules
- no dependencies which need to be compiled
  (i.e., you don't have to run make during instillation)
- more modular, it is easier to load only those parts of the starter
  kit you anticipate actually using

This repository could still be appropriate if for some reason you are
not able to install Emacs24 (the development version) on your system.
Emacs 24 may be easily built from source on linux systems, Mac
binaries can be downloaded from the "Nightlies" section of
http://emacsformacosx.com/builds
